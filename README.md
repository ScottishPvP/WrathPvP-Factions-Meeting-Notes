# WrathPvP-Factions-Meeting-Notes
This contains notes on the subjects need talked about in the staff meet on 11/10/2015.


WrathPvP Factions:
~ The Factions Server is in need of a reset now. its  been going on for a wee while now and the time has come. People do
  want this and people are saying the map has gone on long enough now.
  
  :- My First point i would like to know is, Do we have a spawn already made or are we planning one making it ourselfs?
  
  :- MY next point is something i was asking about on the server but its more needed on the forums also. it is that do
     we maybe make a reminiscing map. So by this i mean looking back at maps 1-4 and bring one of them back for some old
     memories. Maybe Harreehhh, ELi and myselve could work on re building it if u dont have them backed up.
     
  :- The Spawn size should be either the same as the current or maybe even a tad bit smaller dosent matter as long as not
     any bigger.
     
  :- The Factions side will need a New Warp Donor/New Shop.
  
  :- People would like to see a Raid shop also. Maybe something I can look into getting some more information on as to what 
     would be inserted into this shop.
     
  :- A player from the server called BenKeeble is asking in regard to making it so that Hoppers can only be obtainable via 
     the shop. By this he means making it so they cant be crafted. This Is to help the economy not be so inflated so fast. And 
     mean to work for the cash before they can buy and would mean having to get farms built slower.
     
  :- So in Regard to Koths and DropZones. Can we look into reducing how often the are on/dropped. From what I have been hearing 
     everyone is fairly rich and got to the point where they no longer need the loot as its on so often and they are always getting 
     it because not that many players are on.     I mention on the forums post in regard to monotoring it for the first week or 2.

  :- Many For Floyd:  Can I please get a full background into this Connection lag issue. I am been told people cant pvp with 
     it and it is taking an effect on afking. So if its taking an effect on afking that will need to be addressed.
     :- Good news is that its been running ok for a couple of days now (08/10/2015)
     :- I have said it will be something we will be monitoring over and making sure its running better.
     :- today 09/10/2015 there was an instance when the server started doing that 3 bars thing and everyone was saying lag ;D
        the word u love.
  :- BenKeeble was saying there was a issue with DropZoneâ€™s Not working right a few days ago(08/10/2015 Date this was Writing
     at) But I asked about it and he said its been fine now. Not sure if u already knew about it or not. https://gyazo.com/011ba6c82d43c58ce7117af6a5a3cf6a
